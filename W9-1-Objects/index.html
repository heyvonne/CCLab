                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>NASA launched Project A, sending three astronauts to explore a mysterious planet. But everything went
                    wrong when Chris’ spaceship malfunctioned, ejecting him into deep space. He called for help, but his
                    two teammates abandoned him to save themselves. Drifting alone, he found a strange, glowing
                    substance floating in the void. Desperate, he consumed it—and felt his body begin to change. He was
                    growing, evolving into something beyond human. Now, he had a choice: Consume all and let his old
                    friends die, or stay silent, vanish into the void, and take the secret of his transformation with
                    him. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The Agario lives in the cold, dark emptiness of space, floating between the stars. It survives by
                    eating anything it can find, growing bigger as it consumes energy and matter.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The creature was once human, but after consuming the glowing substance, the Agario's greed for more
                    drives it to grow larger, changing color and size with each consumption. Intrigued by these changes,
                    it becomes determined to keep searching for more substances to feed on.</p>

                The agario was once human, but after eating a glowing substance in space, it starts to change. First,
                its hands and arms grow, then its whole body gets bigger. Each time it eats, its color and size change,
                and it becomes more driven to find more to consume. The creature’s hunger keeps growing, making it
                unpredictable and dangerous.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Humans should avoid
                approaching or interacting with the creature, as it becomes more dangerous with each substance it
                consumes. Keeping a safe distance and not offering any energy or matter is crucial to prevent triggering
                its hunger and aggression.
